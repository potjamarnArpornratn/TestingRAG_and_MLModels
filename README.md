# TestingMLModels
I created this repository as a general knowledge base for anyone who needs to learn how to test AI Model.
Contents of this repo came from the knowledge that I acquired for Model validation as part of my job routine.

In order to validate the ML Model, I'll utilize LangChain and PromptTemplate.  I'll create LCEL for the model validation.
The following libraries need to be imported before we invoke the methods: 
- from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
- from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableLambda
- from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

Then LLM, parameters, template, and prompt need to be initialized prior to building LCEL 

I'll add examples as I move forward with building the custom application 

# Remark:  I'll continue to update this repo with more contents...
